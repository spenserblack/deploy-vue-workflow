# deploy-vue-workflow

View [`.github/workflows/deploy.yml`](./.github/workflows/deploy.yml) to view the workflow.
You will probably want to edit the [workflow triggers](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/events-that-trigger-workflows#configuring-workflow-events).

You will need to go to your repository's settings, go to "Pages", and then set the source to `gh-pages`.
You will also need to [set `vue.config.js` accordingly](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/events-that-trigger-workflows#configuring-workflow-events).
